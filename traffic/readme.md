Local Traffic Conditions
========================

Thanks to Google Maps API, traffic conditions are pretty simple. Set a few custom attributes and turn on the traffic layer and you're all set. Added a little map key in the bottom right and thats about it. 25,000 requests/day. No worries here on daily limit.
