Digital Signage Examples
========================

Three sample screens used for a company's lobby display monitor. These examples are built specifically for a monitor with a display resolution of 1366px x 768px. Because these screens are being used in a controlled environment, the normal precautions for browser and screen variations are not being taken into consideration. 

Code examples include:

*   7 Day Local Forecast
*   Current Radar Conditions
*   Current Traffic Conditions

These screens are being used in conjunction with digital software that controls the display schedule as well as the refresh rate. As a stand alone version they would not auto refresh to keep the current conditions, but a quick search will identify several ways you can accomplish this. 

Each example is making use of free API services that have a limited number of daily calls. So please be aware of your refresh rate. See individual examples for specific daily limits.

### Also, please sign up for your own free accounts and swap out the API keys before you begin testing with the code samples. If not the daily limits may be reach and the accounts will be disabled.
